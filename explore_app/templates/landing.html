                You can give it a try, but this website isn't really optimized for mobile. We'd suggest visting on your
                computer. You can definitely still read all the documentation. And we won't stop you from trying to do more, but 
                the experience may not be as good.

                This website provides an interface to browse, label, and download nearly 1000 rolls of digitized optical
                film containing data from the earliest large-scale ice-penetrating radar survey of Antarctica. The data
                available here was gathered in the late 1960s and 1970s as part of an Antarctic airborne geophysical survey.
                Conducted by an international consortium of American, British and Danish geoscientists, the airborne
                surveys used a converted American military C-130 long-range aircraft. The decade-long effort involved
                crisscrossing Antarctica repeatedly, covering a total of about a quarter million line-miles, and using
                ice-penetrating radar to peer beneath the surface down to a depth of about 3 miles.
